Connected to the database and executed SQL queries to merge multiple tables.
Applied filtering, aggregation, and joins for meaningful data structure.

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Identified seasonal peaks in revenue and profit.
Analyzed distribution of order values and high-margin price bands.
Investigated product and regional performance trends.

4️⃣ Power BI Dashboard Creation

Designed three dashboards:
Executive Overview & Trends – Business KPIs, monthly trends, and customer order analysis.
Product & Channel Performance – Best-selling products, profit leaders, and channel performance.
