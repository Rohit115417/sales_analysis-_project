Connected to the database and executed SQL queries to merge multiple tables.
Applied filtering, aggregation, and joins for meaningful data structure.

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Identified seasonal peaks in revenue and profit.
Analyzed distribution of order values and high-margin price bands.
Investigated product and regional performance trends.

4️⃣ Power BI Dashboard Creation
Designed three dashboards:
